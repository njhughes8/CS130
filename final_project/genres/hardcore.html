                <p>Back to the heavy stuff! Hardcore, or Hard Dance to some, is an aptly named genre that is 
                    not necessarily “hardcore” due to its sound design, but rather its incredibly fast-paced nature. 
                    Whereas a track around 120 BPM is easier to sit around and groove to, Hardcore music is usually 
                    close to 170 BPM - a bigger difference than many realize. Think of a 4/4 house-style beat structure 
                    and then speed that up a lot. Add in hard-hitting percussion and production that isn’t necessarily 
                    gritty on the ears but most definitely loud and rave-worthy and you’ve got yourself a Hardcore track! 
                    A very popular offshoot is known as Happy Hardcore, a more melodic take on this speedy genre. Hardcore 
                    music is perfect for workout playlists in my opinion - it never fails to get me on my feet and make 
                    me want to get active. Some popular Hardcore DJs include Code Black, Hixxy, and nanobii. </p>

                <p>Slotting into the Happy Hardcore side of things, it’s not hard to tell the difference in tempo between 
                    this genre and most others. “Sky Is Falling” is produced by Darren Styles and Stonebank, with a vocal 
                    feature from EMEL. There is a trend with a lot of the highlights I have chosen, and that is the sense 
                    of euphoria that they provide. This song is no exception, as a constant driving baseline and a light 
                    yet forceful lead melody paired with atmospheric off-drop sections create a beautiful medley of rave-ready 
                    goodness. And, as I mentioned a few times, the speed of this track sets it apart. Clocking in at a whopping 
                    172 BPM, “Sky Is Falling” is best described as a rather rapid anthem. If you’re into jumping around and 
                    pumping your fists in the air in quick succession while enjoying good tunes, have I got the song for you. </p>
