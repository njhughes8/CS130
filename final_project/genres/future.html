                <p>Future Bass is a genre that has really taken off in the last few years within the electronic music 
                scene. A lighter sounding version of its sister genre, trap, future bass is particularly codified 
                by warm, stabby synths, buzzing baselines, inviting melodies, and filtered chord progressions with 
                a fair amount of reverb. This genre is known for taking the harsher sounds of trap and dubstep and 
                utilizing a similar beat structure with happier, lighter, perhaps even bouncier sounds. The tempos 
                generally sit within the 130 to 160 BPM range, providing faster yet still danceable tracks. A few 
                notable artists who have seen success with the genre include The Chainsmokers, Flume, and Louis the 
                Child. </p>

                <p>The song I have chosen to represent Future Bass is a song called “Overflow” written by smle with 
                vocals performed by Helen Tess. What I think this song does well to capture the genre is its 
                inherent bounciness. The wavy production evident in the song’s synths gives the song a very groovy 
                feel, and coupled with Tess’ light and airy vocals create an infectious melody that makes it hard 
                not to bob your head. Comparing this to a trap or a dubstep track, it becomes more clear what I 
                meant by taking stylistic elements of those genres and putting a lighter spin on them. Relaxing 
                yet captivating, “Overflow” is a must-use in summer playlists. </p>
