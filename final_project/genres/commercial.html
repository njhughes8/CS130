                <p>Commercial House is an aptly named genre of electronic music that encapsulates a variety of 
                    different house tracks that have a “commercial” feel to them. Generally centered around 128 
                    BPM, this type of house music represents the intersection between top 40 radio hits and house 
                    music, hence “commercial.” As such, many house tracks that people know very well can be tagged 
                    with this moniker, like “Levels” by Avicii. Radio-friendly vocals, catchy melodies, the classic 
                    4-on-the-floor beat structure, and hard-hitting yet danceable toplines are the key features of 
                    this genre. Once widely referred to as “Progressive House,” that title already had a home with 
                    a much different sounding branch of house music. This genre of music is really more of a 
                    container for house music that has found its way into mainstream listening, but the 
                    similarities between those successes were enough to warrant a new name. Some artists you may 
                    have heard of that have produced this type of music include David Guetta, Calvin Harris, and 
                    Tiësto.

                <p>I really do love this song. “Ghost in the Machine” by Trivecta isn’t a song many of you will 
                    have heard of, but is a perfect example of a radio-friendly tune with top notch production. 
                    Fantastic uncredited vocals from RØRY and an infectious melody over a house beat make this a 
                    song anyone would have a good time listening to. Boasting a somewhat euphoric feel to its 
                    instrumental, this track is perfect for both radio play and festival listening. This truly 
                    makes me feel like I’m listening to 2012 Calvin Harris for the first time again, which is 
                    impressive considering the more modern production value. It’s simply a shame it didn’t blow 
                    up in the mainstream like it deserves to.
