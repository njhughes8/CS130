                <p>Not to be confused with Commercial House as I alluded to in that description, Progressive House 
                    is all about the atmosphere and worldbuilding. One of the most noticeable things about this 
                    genre is that the songs tend to be longer than most EDM songs, as the progression through the 
                    song for which the genre was named is the most important element. Progressive House artists are 
                    always aiming to take you on a journey with their music, and a 3 minute song usually does not 
                    suffice. Percussion is usually light, but kick and snare drums are pretty constant. Vocals are 
                    rarely used, but complex melodies cover up that issue very nicely. These songs are also very 
                    synth-driven most of the time. This is, of course, on top of house music’s notorious 4-on-the-floor 
                    beat structure. When you listen to Progressive House, focus on the emotion and the journey that 
                    the song provides. Some great artists to listen to include Nigel Good, Shingo Nakamura, and 
                    RÜFÜS DU SOL. </p>

                <p>This is the only song that is highlighted on this webpage that is produced by an artist I recommend 
                    in the genre description (in an effort to provide more artists to listen to), but I simply cannot 
                    leave out the masterpiece that is “Space Plus One” by Nigel Good. His album “Space Cadet” has a 
                    very special place in my heart, and this song is my favorite of the bunch. Plucky synths and catchy 
                    vocal chops on top of a light bassline make this song a phenomenal example of the genre. Nigel Good 
                    captures his idea of outer space perfectly with this song in my opinion, and it is well worth the 
                    6.5 minute listen. Whether that be easy background listening for working or a deeper listen to 
                    appreciate the journey through the song’s progression, “Space Plus One” will provide. Listen to 
                    the rest of the album while you’re at it! I promise you won’t be disappointed.</p>
