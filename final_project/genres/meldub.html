                <p>Take everything I said about Dubstep being a foundational genre, and add a bit of euphoria. 
                    That truly is the best word to describe Melodic Dubstep as a genre. Clearly not a far deviation 
                    from Dubstep itself, MelDub uses the same beat structures and many of the same instrumental 
                    elements but with production that brings euphoric emotion to the forefront of the listeners’ minds. 
                    While technically a subgenre of Dubstep, MelDub’s typical stylistic elements are so wildly 
                    different and honestly closer to a future bass sound that it warrants its own entry on my list. 
                    This genre is often very vocal driven and melody focused, as the name would suggest. One might find 
                    powerful chords and harmonious sound design when listening to this type of EDM. The genre also 
                    provides a lot of room for acoustic instrumentals than a lot of EDM does, perhaps a piano or a 
                    guitar intro leading into a hard-hitting melody. A few notable Melodic Dubstep producers include 
                    Seven Lions, ILLENIUM, and William Black. </p>

                <p>MiTiS is one of my current favorite Melodic Dubstep artists out there, and his song “Try” is one of 
                    his best to date. Piano chords and acoustic guitar performance brings about a layer of emotion, which 
                    is carried on by RØRY’s beautiful vocals and brought to a peak with a truly uplifting bass sound. 
                    Hard hitting synths over a 2-step beat sounds like it would be associated with regular ol’ Dubstep, 
                    but euphoria wins out in this song due to emotionally charged production throughout the track. Try to 
                    sit around and listen to this song when you find yourself mad or unhappy in any way. Difficult to stay 
                    that way, right? MiTiS has been absolutely killing the game lately, and this song is a perfect example of why.
