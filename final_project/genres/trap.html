                <p>Trap as a genre is a combination of influences from a wide variety of different genres that 
                    may not originally seem to mesh well together. Production elements inspired by another genre 
                    called Trap (this being the hip-hop offshoot that began in the South) combined with beat and 
                    design elements hailing mostly from dubstep created the Trap that EDM knows and loves today. 
                    Trap tends to have a darker melodic tone to it, coupled with more aggressive sounding beats 
                    that use low and hard 808s and a whole lot of snare drum action. Though the genre of trap in 
                    the EDM world and the rap world are different, the rap influence tends to blend quite well 
                    with the electronic elements and it has become very common to combine the two. Artists that 
                    have taken off with the trap genre include RL Grime, Dillon Francis, and Marshmello.

                <p>Flosstradamus has become quite the denizen of trap in recent years, and their track “2MUCH” 
                    featuring 24hrs is a perfect example of this. What this track does particularly well as a 
                    genre showcase is its use of the aforementioned influences. The dubstep influence is clear - 
                    a grimy and gritty drop section on top of a slower beat structure. The rap blend works nicely 
                    here as well, as 24hrs’ vocals show just how well the two styles blend together. The hip-hop 
                    beat rife with plentiful hi-hats and heavy 808 work brings everything together to create an 
                    all-around banging track. The song carries a very powerful energy throughout, one that 
                    encourages moshing around and going crazy. This song is a great one for festival listening 
                    and college party goers alike. Have fun raging! </p>
