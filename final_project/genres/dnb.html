                <p>Back to back very recognizable genres in my opinion, I believe Drum & Bass to be the easiest 
                    to pick out of a bunch. The DnB beat structure is so iconic that it would be incredibly hard 
                    to not hear when listening to a song. Fast-paced breakbeats are what make this genre stand 
                    out, in particular a very specific kick-snare structure falling on the 1-2 and 3.5-4 beats 
                    of a measure respectively. DnB songs typically have a tempo around 165-185 BPM, potentially 
                    the fastest of the genres today given the right track. DnB songs can take a chiller, more 
                    melodic route, a euphoric and uplifting one, or a dark and foreboding one when it comes to 
                    stylistic choices, but unlike other genres these differences still remain under the Drum & 
                    Bass umbrella due to its unique beat structure. Think of garage style breakbeats, make the 
                    beat more specific, then ramp up the pace, and presto! You’ve got yourself a Drum & Bass 
                    track! Popular Drum & Bass artists include Metrik, Pendulum, and MUZZ. </p>

                <p>All caps for the title of the song and the artist’s name styling are absolutely necessary to 
                    capture the energy that REAPER puts forward in his music. His song “BARRICADE” was among my 
                    top played songs of 2020, and for good reason. A funky intro melody paired with some dark 
                    vocals leads into some of the most high energy music I have highlighted today. Heavy lead 
                    sounds in the drop sequence place this song on the darker route for DnB, so if that isn’t 
                    your style it is understandable how this song may come off as a little too heavy. But come 
                    on, just listen to how powerful the song sounds! As previously mentioned, the DnB beat 
                    structure is evident throughout the entire song and the pace at which you are hit with kick 
                    drums is what really musters up all that power and force. Perfect for a workout playlist! I 
                    run to this song a lot because I always feel like I’m being chased and need to run faster, go 
                    figure.
