                <p>Garage music originated in the UK in the 90s and is perhaps one of the most recognizable 
                    genres to the untrained ear due to its rather unique set of samples and beat structures. 
                    Heavy use of percussion, syncopated hi-hats, chopped up vocal samples, and common use of 
                    breakbeat structures are what set this genre apart. That said, the percussion samples used 
                    in a lot of Garage tracks are widely used by most Garage producers, which makes the genre 
                    recognizable if one were to single out the kick and snare samples. Garage music tends to be 
                    fairly uptempo, sitting around 130 BPM. It also tends to have a more chill aura about it, 
                    foregoing the grittier sounds of heavier EDM for a more relaxing feel and letting complex 
                    beat work capture the listener instead. Some popular Garage artists include Drinks On Me, 
                    Higgo, and CloudNone. </p>

                <p>Direct has been making Garage tracks for a long time now, and he has truly mastered his craft. 
                    His song “I Know” is a great way to show just what Garage is to new listeners, and is one of 
                    my favorites of his to date. There really may not be a more perfect example given what I have 
                    described above; vocal chops on top of a breakbeat structure are the driving force behind “I 
                    Know,” and the common garage kick and snare samples are utilized to their fullest in creating 
                    an interesting beat. The production of this song may seem simplistic compared to some of the 
                    other songs I have chosen, but I choose to look at that as a plus rather than a downside. 
                    Direct produced a song that does not rely on heavy hitting melodies to create the same 
                    emotional response. “Less is more,” some have said, and I believe that this track uses less 
                    to be way more impactful than a lot of songs. Great music for studying or lying in the sun. </p>
