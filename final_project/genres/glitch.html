                <p> Glitch Hop is a very fun genre to talk about, mainly because it is known for being quite funky. 
                    A fun blend of EDM, beats with inspiration from hip-hop, and sounds reminiscent of video games 
                    gave Glitch Hop its start, but over time the genre has moved away from the hip-hop influence 
                    and steadily towards trap and dubstep inspiration. When you think “glitch,” think of track 
                    skipping, distorted audio, vocal chops, cutting, or anything that would make you think of a 
                    track as “glitchy.” This genre is also sometimes referred to as simply 110 BPM because that’s 
                    where the genre generally resides. 110 BPM is a very recognizable tempo as well, especially 
                    when compared to faster house tempos or even faster Hardcore tempos. A couple of notable Glitch 
                    Hop creators include Teminite, Rob Gasser, and TheFatRat.

                <p>Where to begin with this song? A funky, stuttery beat opens the listening, piano chords 
                    carry us into mellow vocals, and then the “glitch” hits. The lead melody sounds like 
                    something straight out of an early 2000s video game, and is very warped and choppy if you 
                    listen closely. Take note of the speed of the track. If you were to count 4 beats per measure 
                    the count would be much slower than previous examples (just an exercise to show what I mean 
                    by 110 BPM being that much more noticeable). The small production choices in this track are 
                    all so nicely melded together in a track I never expected to love as much as I do now. 
                    Glacier did a wonderful job with his track, “Ubi,” really showcasing just how groovy 
                    Glitch Hop can be. </p>
