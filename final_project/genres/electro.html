                <p>This is the first genre on the list that is best described by the term “heavy.” Yet another 
                    house genre, Electro House utilizes house music’s 4-on-the-floor beat with heavy, gritty 
                    basslines, and generally has a harsher feel than other genres of house. This genre definitely 
                    takes house music to its limit in that sense. That is not to detract from its musicality, 
                    however; no one would bother giving this genre the time of day if it wasn’t worth a listen. 
                    Some other common features of Electro House tunes are buzzing sawtooth waves, a tempo around 
                    130 BPM, distortion, and thumping kick drums. Some artists who have thrived creating electro 
                    house include Ghastly, Dyro, and Au5. </p>

                <p>I picked the song “dashstar*” by Knock2 as a sample for this genre. And let me tell you, this 
                    song hits. Hard. Drawn in by an alluring vocal sample, this song begins in a much darker fashion 
                    than the other house tracks I have chosen to highlight. A buzzy and gritty lead sound on top of 
                    a fast, kicking beat fill this song with an aura of action and power. Like I said, it hits. 
                    Makes me feel like I’m standing front row at a music festival with fire blowing above my head 
                    as the DJ plays their first song of the set, and that feeling is exactly what I am looking for 
                    in an Electro House track.
