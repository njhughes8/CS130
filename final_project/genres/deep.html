                <p>Deep House is a genre of house music with homegrown roots. Originating in Chicago, IL in the 
                    late 80s, Deep House spins classic house structures with elements of funk and generally has 
                    less and/or more muted percussion than other house genres. It also tends to be slower than 
                    other house genres (around 110-125 BPM), which creates a more groove-centered structure 
                    compared to a faster, make-you-want-to-jump framework. In that regard, the more mellow 
                    approach to house music is often accompanied by soulful vocals and more minimalistic 
                    production. Not to say that the production is worse in any way, just that it comes off as 
                    less in-your-face than other genres. Artists who make a lot of great Deep House include 
                    Oliver Heldens, Duke Dumont, and EDX.

                <p>See what I mean when I said groovy and more mellow? “Cheque” by Don Diablo manages to remain 
                    both punchy and infectious while maintaining a more mellow atmosphere compared to something 
                    in the Commercial House genre. A smooth set of vocals and a groovable melody coupled with a 
                    laid back yet minimal beat structure make this song a perfect party anthem. To top it all 
                    off, a low, reverb-filled lead sound gives the track an aura that is, well, deep. I feel 
                    like I ought to be walking into a club listening to this song in order to truly match the 
                    vibe it gives off.
