                <p>Enter headbanging. This genre is not for the faint of heart. One of EDM’s heaviest offspring, 
                    Dubstep encapsulates what it means for a song to “drop.” I daresay that this is what most non-EDM 
                    listeners believe all EDM tends to sound like, and that is not for no reason. It is certainly one 
                    of the more standout genres under the EDM umbrella, constituted by hard-hitting and gritty basslines, 
                    heavy lead sounds, and a slower rhythm in more of a 2-step fashion. This is the go-to genre for those 
                    looking to rage the night away at a festival. Dubstep serves as the foundation for a lot of modern 
                    EDM genres, a rather aggressive cornerstone if I do say so myself. Some popular Dubstep producers 
                    include Skrillex, Excision, and Teminite. </p>

                <p>Somewhat of a departure from what many associate with dubstep, “New Amsterdam” by Fox Stevenson begins 
                    with a lovely vocal performance from Fox himself. But don’t be fooled - this song shows off everything 
                    that makes dubstep great. Heavy hitting lead sounds, a driving bassline, and thick kick drums create a 
                    drop sequence that is hard not to bop your head back and forth to. This song is also a good example of 
                    the 2-step beat structure in comparison to, say, a house track. Kick drums are heavy, but only hit on 
                    the 1 and 3 beats of the 4 bar measure. “New Amsterdam” carries a certain energy with it, and that massive 
                    energy is exactly what brings people back to Dubstep. </p>
