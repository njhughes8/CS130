               I've loved listening to electronic music for a long time now. Electronic dance music, or "EDM," 
               has proliferated itself into many areas of everyday life like commercials and social media, but 
               still many people have no idea just how broad of a type of music it is. This is your one-stop shop
               for beginning to understand the differences between a handful of electronic genres. Below, you will
               find links to a brief description of each genre along with a few songs handpicked by me as a genre 
               showcase.
